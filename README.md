# Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

## Overview

This project utilizes data from a DVD rental database to inform future marketing strategies. By analyzing and aggregating the data, the project calculates the total monetary value generated by each actor from movies rented at the store. The top three highest-grossing actors are identified, providing actionable insights for the marketing team to develop targeted campaigns.

## Features

- **Granular Data Organization**: Created a **detailed table** for actor and film performance metrics and a **summary table** for aggregated insights, including the top three highest-grossing actors.
- **Automation and Optimization**: Incorporated stored procedures, triggers, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to automate data aggregation and maintain table freshness.  
- **PostgreSQL Implementation**: Utilized advanced PostgreSQL techniques to extract, transform, and organize data from multiple related tables in the DVD rental database.

## What I Learned
