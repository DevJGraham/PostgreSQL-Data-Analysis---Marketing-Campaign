# Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

## Overview

This project utilizes data from a DVD rental database to inform future marketing strategies. By analyzing and aggregating the data, the project calculates the total monetary value generated by each actor from movies rented at the store. The top three highest-grossing actors are identified, providing actionable insights for the marketing team to develop targeted campaigns.

## Features

- **Data Organization**: Created a **detailed table** for actor and film performance metrics and a **summary table** for aggregated insights, including the top three highest-grossing actors.
- **PostgreSQL Automation**: Utilized stored procedures, triggers, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to automate data aggregation and ensure table freshness.  
- **Custom Transformations**: Designed user-defined functions to enhance data readability, streamlining reporting and analysis.  

## What I Learned

- **Advanced PostgreSQL**: Strengthened skills in stored procedures, triggers, CTEs, and user-defined functions to optimize and automate workflows.  
- **Data Insights**: Gained experience in transforming raw data into structured insights for both granular analysis and high-level summaries.  
- **Automation**: Developed techniques for creating self-updating tables, preparing for scalable and dynamic database projects.
